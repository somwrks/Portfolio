    "detail2": "SafeSentry features a log-in/authentication system, where a student can use their student ID # or any applicable information (school email, etc…) to register with our app. After being registered and added to their own school ecosystem, the student has the ability to file evidence-based incident reports in the event of suspicious activity or if they get any information about crimes that take place or will take place. Filing reports can often be painstaking and slow, but our app allows a student to securely file one that can make the difference towards the prevention of a school shooting.",
    "detail3": "But then, SafeSentry also has an interactive map feature that shows locations of incident reports, safety exits, safety shelters, etc… Having knowledge of these locations can be lifesaving in the event of an actual shooter being on campus. If an actual threat is on campus, and a student is trying to remain concealed or in hiding, they can quickly use our Emergency Aid feature and with a click of a button, alert local authorities. Local Authorities and School Administrators can also use the timeline location feature to track students in times of emergency through their accounts. Overall, SafeSentry has been equipped with innovative never-before-seen features that can help reduce the casualties in the event of a school shooting or prevent one entirely.",
